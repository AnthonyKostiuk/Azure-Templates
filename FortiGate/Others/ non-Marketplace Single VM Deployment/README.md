## This template set is designed for deploying FortiGate in Azure without access to the Azure Marketplace.  The following are created:
    - vnet with two subnets
                or uses an existing vnet of your selection.  If using an existing vnet, it must already have two subnets.
    - Public IP
    - Two route tables
    - FortiGate virtual appliances
    
To use this template, you must already have a storage account configured with an "images" container and the Azure version of the FortiGate vhd inside that container.
